__Title:__ "Introduction to Bayesian Inference and PyMC3"

__Date:__ 2018 09 02

The following lecture was given at the Fraternali Group Retreat. The lecture covers fundamentals of Bayesian data analysis, inferring a Binomial probability via analytical solution and Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. 

In addition, the lecture is supplemented with a Jupyter Notebook containing Python code examples to perform Bayesian analysis. Three specific methods are mentioned: (i) calculating posterior Beta distribution via updating Scipy Beta distribution function, (ii) calculating posterior Beta distribution via calculating Bernoulli likelihood and (iii) inferring a Binomial distribution using PyMC3.

The lecture covers "Doing Bayesian Data Analysis" by John K. Kruschke and "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher M. Bishop material.
